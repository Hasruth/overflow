                <p>KTM AG (Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen; formerly KTM Sportmotorcycle AG[4][5]) is an Austrian
                    motorcycle,
                    bicycle and sports car manufacturer owned by Pierer Mobility AG and the Indian manufacturer Bajaj
                    Auto.
                    It
                    was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934. Today, KTM AG is the parent
                    company of
                    the
                    KTM Group, consisting of a number of motorcycle brands.

                    KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s,
                    it
                    has
                    expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars – namely the X-Bow. In 2015,
                    KTM
                    sold
                    almost as many street as off-road bikes.[6]

                    From 2012, KTM was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years.[7][8]
                    Globally,
                    the company is among the leading off-road motorcycle manufacturers.[9][10] In 2016, KTM sold 203,423
                    motor
                    vehicles worldwide.[11]

                    History

                    Hans Trunkenpolz and Ernst Kronreif
                    Early years
                    In 1934, an Austrian engineer Johann (Hans) Trunkenpolz (1909–1962)[12] set up a fitter's and car
                    repair
                    shop[13] in Mattighofen. In 1937, he started selling DKW motorcycles, and Opel cars the following
                    year.
                    His
                    shop was known as Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen, but the name was unregistered. During the
                    Second
                    World War, his wife took care of the business which was thriving mainly on account of diesel engine
                    repairs.[14]

                    After the war, demand for repair works fell sharply and Trunkenpolz started thinking about producing
                    his
                    own
                    motorcycles. The prototype of his first motorcycle, the R100, was built in 1951.[15] The components
                    of
                    the
                    motorcycle were produced in house, except for the Rotax engines which were made by Fichtel & Sachs.
                    Serial
                    production of the R100 started in 1953. With just 20 employees, motorcycles were built at a rate of
                    three
                    per day.[16]

                    KTM 1953–1991
                    In 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a major shareholder of the company, which was renamed and
                    registered as Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. In 1954, the R125 Tourist was introduced,[17]
                    followed
                    by
                    the Grand Tourist[18] and the scooter Mirabell[19] in 1955.

                    The company secured its first racing title in the 1954 Austrian 125cc national championship.[20] In
                    1956,
                    KTM made its appearance at the International Six Days Trials, where Egon Dornauer won a gold medal
                    on a
                    KTM
                    machine.[21]

                    In 1957, KTM built its first sports motorcycle, the Trophy 125cc.[22] KTM's first moped, named
                    Mecky,
                    was
                    launched in 1957, followed by Ponny I in 1960 and Ponny II in 1962 and Comet in 1963.[23] The 1960s
                    also
                    saw
                    the beginning of bicycle production in Mattighofen.</p>

                <img src="./royalenfield.png" alt="ROYAL ENFIELD">
                <p>After the Indian Independence Act 1947 the new government looked for a suitable motorcycle for its
                    army
                    to
                    patrol the country's border. In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike
                    for
                    the
                    job. In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company
                    partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc
                    Royal
                    Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so
                    that
                    they
                    could manufacture components.[7] By 1962, all the components were made in India. The Indian Enfield
                    uses
                    the
                    1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in
                    the
                    350 cc
                    and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.[8]

                    In the year 1990, Royal Enfield collaborated with the Eicher Group, an automotive company in India,
                    and
                    merged with it in 1994.[9] Apart from bikes, Eicher Group is involved in the production and sales of
                    commercial vehicles and automotive gears. Although Royal Enfield experienced difficulties in the
                    1990s,
                    and
                    ceased motorcycle production at their Jaipur factory in 2002,[10] by 2013 the company opened a new
                    primary
                    factory in the Chennai suburb of Oragadam on the strength of increased demand for its motorcycles.
                    This
                    was
                    followed in 2017 by the inauguration of another new factory of a similar size to the facility at
                    Oragadam
                    (capacity 600,000 vehicles per year) at Vallam Vadagal. The original factory at Tiruvottiyur became
                    secondary, and continues to produce some limited-run motorcycle models.[11][12][13][14]

                    Flooding, produced by the heaviest rainfall in Chennai in over a century, caused Royal Enfield to
                    cut
                    production by 4,000 motorcycles in November 2015, followed by a shutdown of the plants in
                    Thiruvottiyur
                    and
                    Oragadam on 1 December, as well as the company offices in Chennai.[15] Production resumed at 50%
                    capacity on
                    7 December and operations at both plants were back to normal on 14 December.[16]

                    Royal Enfield announced its first takeover of another company in May, 2015 with the purchase of a UK
                    motorcycle design and manufacturing firm, Harris Performance Products,[17][18] that had previously
                    developed
                    the chassis of the Royal Enfield Continental GT Cafe Racer.[19] Harris work with the UK-based part
                    of
                    Royal
                    Enfield's development team, who are based at the UK Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving
                    Ground
                    in
                    Leicestershire. The team was established in January 2015, and moved into their new, purpose-built
                    facility
                    in May 2017. By the end of 2019, the team numbered 155 and carries out the full spectrum of design
                    and
                    development activities, from concept generation and clay design to engineering design, prototyping
                    and
                    validation.

                    Royal Enfield currently sells motorcycles in more than 50 countries. Royal Enfield surpassed
                    Harley-Davidson
                    in global sales in 2015.[20][21]

                    2014 Continental GT 535
                    In August 2015, Royal Enfield Motors announced it is establishing its North American headquarters
                    and a
                    dealership in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the intention to offer three bikes, the Bullet 500, Classic
                    500
                    and
                    Continental GT 535 Cafe Racer as they feel this engine size represents an under-served market. The
                    dealership will be Royal Enfield's first company-owned store in the U.S., according to Rod Copes,
                    president
                    of Royal Enfield North America.[22][23] The company wants to establish about 100 dealerships in
                    American
                    cities starting with Milwaukee.</p>
